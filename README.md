telerik.com Web App testing repository

This repository was created to test current version of Telerik website. I am currently developing my QA Engineering skills that is why I have chosen Progress Company App 
to create a full set of tests of their Product. A structure of 61 test cases was raised, divided by prioritization along with where on the website the tests had occured. 
All actions happened on three portals:
* GitHub - which is the basepoint for all other referenced Apps along with code for automation
* TestRail - where I have created the structure of the whole Project and created reports from
* Jira - where all Epics, bugs and Sprints were logged

In regards to TestRail and Jira I have been using free versions of those Apps thus some funcionalities can be limited:
- Jira access can be given only to individuals via Admin approval (please send request to przybeckikrzysiek@gmail.com)
- TestRail offers full access but on a limited by time window. Most of the data after 9/1/2024 will be available only on exported Reports and files describing
  structure of the project.

Most of the bugs located are within UI, mostly on Mobile devices, also on Desktop, but only when the user's browsing window does not fit the whole page. 
Though in a few cases, also critical ones I would suggest more prompt action as bugs like SDA-3 or SDA-4 could potentially lead to losing a customer.
Another proposal would be a more unified approach to objects within one class/more coherent approach to what happens after a user goes “deeper” into subpages. 
Some subpages refer to the same form/subpage whereas others, with similar objects, act differently or show data that could be more unified with other 
objects and the way the whole Application works. From the below link you will be able to find my project sum up.

If you have any further questions/want to request access to Jira do not hesitate to contact me directly on przybeckikrzysiek@gmail.com

Yours sincerely,
Krzysztof Przybecki
